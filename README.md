Hello, my name is Caleb and I code as a hobby. My best friend guided me a couple years ago since he is a CS major and I have worked on countless problems in my free time.

I started with Project Euler as I had a more mathematical background, which helped me along. My enjoyment of number theory probably contributed to my drive
to continue programming and understanding more challenging ideas and problems. More recently I have taken to LeetCode and since received the Google foo.bar invitation, so I have been working on that.

I am currently enrolled in university as an Aerospace Engineer, not CS. I have had much overlap with computing and programming through courses like numerical methods
and basic C++ and MATLAB courses.

The goal of this repository is to organize all of my projects and completed problems.
